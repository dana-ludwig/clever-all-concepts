# CLEVER (CLinical EVEnt Recognizer) code, including modifications for N2C2, for processing MIMIC III notes as case study

Code relies on the following directory and file structure where directories up to 2-level deep are created by user and all directories that are populated by scripts are indicated below:

nlp/
  clever-mimic3/
    README.txt 			    # file you are reading
    src/ 			          # source code files and directories displayed in execution sequence below
      readme.txt        # operating instructions
      preprocessMimic.py
      step0_embeddings/
        clinical-phrases.sh 	  # invokes code in word2vec directory
        word2vec/
      step1_tagger.py
      step2_weakLabel.py	# has dependencies on step2_weakLabelRuleFcns.py
      step3_weakLabelRuleFcns.py

res/                            # resources
  mimic/
    headers.txt			            # list of section headers in clinical notes
    dicts/                    	# location of terminologies; select one for using with the scripts; they are created by merging a file from base and another from custom directories
      termN2C2.txt              # created by merging contents in base and custom directories
      termDetox.txt             
      termSNOMEDCTbased.txt     
      base/
        clever_base_terminology.txt # list of modifiers 
      custom/
        some_custom_terminology.txt        # list of term_id|term|target-class

    testnotes_formatted.txt	  # file created by preprocessMimic.py
    testnotesmdata.txt		    # file created by preprocessMimic.py
    word2vecOutput/		        # output generated by word2vec, i.e. execution of src/step0_embeddings/clinical-phrases.sh
