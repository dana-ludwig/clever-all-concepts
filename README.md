This Repo is an implementation of the "CLEVER" NLP clinical concept extraction library, created by Suzanne Tamang, and modified for "All Concepts"
by Tanya Podchiyska at Stanford University.  The goal of this version is to implement the recognition of "Composite concepts" such as the co-occurance
of a clinical term, such as "Inflammation" and an anatomic descriptor such as "toes".  The goal is to recognize these new concepts before
they have been added to the source vocabulary.
